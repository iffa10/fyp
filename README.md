CM3070 Final Project - Code

Template chosen: The CM3030 Games Development - Project Idea Title 1: Arcade Game

In this 2D platformer arcade game, players embark on a quest as a knight to save a princess from an evil witch, navigating through three uniquely themed levels. As they progress, the challenges increase, with more spikes, fewer environmental aids like ladders, and tougher enemy behaviors, including battles against orcs and shamans. Players can earn points by collecting items and defeating enemies, aiming to achieve the highest score by completing the levels as quickly and efficiently as possible.
